					<h1>Basic Information</h1>
					<p><strong>PBBA</strong> stands for <strong><em><u>Perennial Big Brother Addiction</u></em></strong> and is one of the least common reality tv disorders affecting only 1 or 2 people annually in the U.S. Up until 2018 it was frequently misdiagnosed as Superfandom. Adults with <strong>PBBA</strong> may have trouble being themselves around others, particularly individuals involved with the production of <strong>BB</strong>. There is an impulsive behavior to do whatever it takes to get their next <strong>BB</strong> fix sometimes at the cost of close personal relationships.</p>

					<h1>Superfans vs PBBA</h1>
					<p>Because PBBA can easily be misdiagnosed as Superfandom we’ve outlined key differences below:</p>
					<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">

								<th class="danger" style="text-align: center;">Superfans</th>
								<th class="success" style="text-align: center;">PBBA</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="danger">❌ <em>Superfans</em> are braggadocious. They are not shy about BB and tell anyone that will give them attention for two minutes</td>
								<td class="success">✔️ <strong>Addicts</strong> typically live their life in a closet, closed off from the world and are embarrassed by their disease</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="danger">❌ <em>Superfans</em> watch the live feeds</td>
								<td class="success">✔️ <strong>Addicts</strong> wait for the pure cut primetime &amp; live shows</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="danger">❌ <em>Superfans</em> are quick to critique/ridicule BB</td>
								<td class="success">✔️ The show is like sex to <strong>Addicts</strong> - they only complain when they aren't getting any</td>

								<td class="success">✔️ <strong>Addicts</strong> name their children after the show</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="danger">❌ Due to <em>Superfans</em> passive lifestyle they lack life experience and thus only talk about past houseguests and past seasons</td>
								<td class="success">✔️ <strong>Addicts</strong> are full of life experiences and therefore have actual stories to share</td>
